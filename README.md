# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This is a Python-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you can play against the computer. The game continues until you decide to quit, and it keeps track of the score.

## How to Play

1. The game asks you to choose between:
   - **Rock**
   - **Paper**
   - **Scissors**

2. You can input your choice in the following ways:
   - **R** or **rock** for Rock
   - **P** or **paper** for Paper
   - **S** or **scissors** for Scissors
   - **Q** or **quit** to stop the game

3. The computer will randomly choose its option.

4. The result (win, lose, or tie) will be displayed, and the game keeps track of your score versus the computer.

5. After each round, you'll be asked if you want to play another round. You can choose:
   - **Y** or **yes** to play again
   - **N** or **no** to end the game

## Features

- Easy-to-use text-based interface.
- Supports both single-letter and full-word inputs for your choice.
- Displays the current score after each round.
- Allows the player to quit at any time.
